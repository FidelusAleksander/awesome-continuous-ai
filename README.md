# Awesome Continuous AI

[Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai/) is any use of automated AI to support software collaboration on any platform. The term aligns with the established concept of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Just as CI/CD transformed software development by automating integration and deployment, Continuous AI covers the ways in which AI can be used to automate and enhance collaboration workflows.

* [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
* [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/)

## Continuous Team Communication

* [Summarize issues with GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/github-models-at-scale/use-models-at-scale#example-use-github-models-with-github-actions-to-summarize-issues) - Use GitHub Models with GitHub Actions to summarize issues when they're closed
* [GenAI Pull Request Descriptor](https://github.com/pelikhan/action-genai-pull-request-descriptor/) - a sample GenAIScript action that updates a pull request description.
* [Video Asset Analyzer](https://github.com/pelikhan/action-genai-video-issue-analyzer) - a sample GenAIScript action that analyzes videos attached as assets to issues.

## Continuous Triage

* [GenAI Issue Labeller](https://github.com/pelikhan/action-genai-issue-labeller) - a sample of using GenAIScript for automated labelling of issues
* [Detect Duplicate Issues, reusable action](https://github.com/pelikhan/action-genai-issue-dedup) - an example of a reusable action using using GitHub Actions, GitHub Models and GenAISCript for issue duplicate detection
* [Detect Duplicate Issues, micro sample](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/.github/workflows/detect-duplicate-issues.yml) - an example of using GitHub Actions+Models for adhoc duplicate detection
* [Detect Non-English Issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/.github/workflows/detect-non-english-issues.yml) - an example of using GitHub Actions+Models to detect issues in an unexpected language
* [GitHub Action Investigator](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/samples/gai/) - automatically analyze a GitHub Action Workflow Job logs and attempts to determine the root cause of the issue

## Continuous Documentation

* [Penify.dev](https://www.penify.dev/) - Penify instantly generates and updates comprehensive documentation for your repository
* [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/) - Automatically generates architecture diagrams, documentation, and links to source code to help you understand unfamiliar codebases quickly

## Continuous Code Review

* [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/) - "Supercharge your team to ship faster with the most advanced AI code reviews"
* [Gemini Code Assist](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code) - "Review GitHub code using Gemini Code Assist" 

## Continuous Code Commenting

* [GenAI Code Commentor](https://github.com/pelikhan/action-genai-commentor/) - a sample of using GenAIScript for automated commenting of code using GitHub Actions and GitHub Models

## Continuous Optimization

* [CodeFlash](https://www.codeflash.ai/) ([GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/codeflash-ai)) - "CodeFlash finds the fastest version of your Python code through benchmarking with AI-powered optimization, verified for correctness every time"

## Continuous Test Improvement
